## Cell Elongation Direction Determination Algorithm

### Objective:
To implement an algorithm for determinating the direction of cell elongation.

### Methodologies: 

In this section, we consider the elongation direction determination algorithm with regard to the cell with contour shown in Fig.1 below. 

Scale bar is 20% of image size (200x200 pixel, 0.0625 Âµm/pixel)
